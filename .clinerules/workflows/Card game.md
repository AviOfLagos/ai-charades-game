WORKFLOW RULES:

1. DEVELOPMENT PHASES:
   Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Structure
   Phase 2: Text Processing Implementation
   Phase 3: Game Logic Development
   Phase 4: UI Implementation
   Phase 5: Integration and Testing
   Phase 6: Refinement and Optimization

2. TASK SEQUENCING:
   - Complete project setup before beginning feature implementation
   - Implement core text processing before game mechanics
   - Build game logic before finalizing UI components
   - Complete basic gameplay before adding advanced features
   - Implement testing throughout development process

3. VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS:
   - Validate text processing accuracy before proceeding to game mechanics
   - Test core game functionality before UI polish
   - Verify multiplayer mechanics before optimization
   - Confirm data persistence before deployment preparation

4. ITERATION APPROACH:
   - Use TaskMaster to track and sequence development tasks
   - Complete MVP functionality before adding enhancements
   - Implement feedback loops at the end of each development phase
   - Prioritize core gameplay over nice-to-have features

5. TESTING WORKFLOW:
   - Write tests alongside or before feature implementation
   - Run test suite after completing each major component
   - Perform manual gameplay testing after automated tests pass
   - Document and address edge cases as they are discovered

6. DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION:
   - Create build optimization configuration
   - Document deployment steps
   - Prepare environment configuration
   - Test production build before finalizing
